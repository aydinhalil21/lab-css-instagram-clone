    <h2><br><br>Directions<br><br></h2>
    

    <p>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring
    to a boil. Reduce temperature and let simmer. <br><br>

    Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded<br>
    slightly. Cover with a lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so<br>
    that it does not run off.<br><br>

    Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175<br>
    degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.</p></div></div>
